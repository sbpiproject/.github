## Project Information
This project's goal is to perform a variety of arithmetic tests on Saddleback's CS3A student project boards, then to provide feedback so students can improve their project boards.
This feedback has been automated in a variety of ways, and can be configured to provide anywhere from entire board tests, down to single addition tests.

## Documentation
